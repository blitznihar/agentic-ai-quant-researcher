# Agentic AI Quant Researcher

An end-to-end, notebook-based quantitative research lab demonstrating
agentic AI design patterns applied to investment finance, combining
fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and robust backtesting.


## Notebook Walkthrough
✔ Fundamental analysis (financial ratios, growth, valuation)
✔ Technical analysis (EMA5, stochastic, candlestick patterns)
✔ Hybrid investment strategies
✔ Walk-forward backtesting & risk metrics
✔ Agentic AI patterns: routing, parallelization, self-reflection,
  evaluator–optimizer loops
✔ Reproducible, research-grade workflow

01. Universe & Data      → Market data + fundamentals ingestion
02. Feature Engineering  → Technical & fundamental signals
03. Strategy Design      → Pure TA, pure fundamentals, hybrid strategies
04. Backtesting          → Walk-forward validation & risk metrics
05. Agentic Evaluation   → Strategy grading & self-reflection loops

## Why “Agentic AI”?
Instead of a single monolithic strategy, this project treats quantitative
research as a multi-agent process:
- Specialized “workers” generate signals and strategies
- An evaluator scores robustness and risk
- Self-reflection guards against common research pitfalls

Later phases will re-implement these workflows using LangGraph, CrewAI,
and other agent frameworks.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
(Phase 2: LangGraph, CrewAI, Multi-Agent LLMs)
