      "| **3** | Architecture map is solid; all layers are modern, but the choice of *NACHA‑compliant ACH processor* (Dwolla vs Stripe Treasury) should reflect volume & jurisdiction. | If you’re in the U.S., Dwolla’s ACH API is good for B2C but Stripe Treasury offers better fraud‑tools. | Run a sandbox test with both and measure API latency (<200 ms). |\n",
      "| **4** | Road‑map phases are realistic, but the *“Go‑Live & Rollout”* window (24‑28 wks) is tight if you’re also training agents. | Include a *“Parallel Run”* period where both legacy and new flows run side‑by‑side for 2 weeks. | Add a “Shadow Mode” KPI: % of calls handled by legacy vs new system.\n",

      "| **Compliance Auditing** | Splunk + Elastic are great, but you’ll need a *structured audit schema* that maps each API call to a policy record. | Define an ERD for “AuditEvent” with fields: `event_id, agent_id, policy_id, action_type, old_value, new_value, timestamp`. |\n",
      "| **Agent Satisfaction** | 30 % admin time is a good baseline; aim for <20 % by adding *macro‑automation* (e.g., auto‑populated fields). | Build a small “AchChangeMacro” that fills in the new bank data block automatically once approved. |\n",
      "| **CX** | CSAT +10pts is ambitious; you must tie it to *speed* (e.g., <90 sec resolution). | Add a KPI: “Time to First Confirm.” If >90 s, trigger an agent pop‑up reminding them of the quick‑confirm button. |\n",
